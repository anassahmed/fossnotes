## About

FOSS Notes is a place where we: Users, developers, SysAdmins or DevOps engineers collaborate together in order to create a set of useful and awesome notes about free and open source software. Those "notes" can be about some known bugs and their solutions, a quick-and-dirty tricks or other useful tips about the software.

FOSS Notes is **not** a place for documentation! For this, you may refer to some other Linux distributions wikis and manuals. We are not trying to create docs, we are creating an online platform where we all share our useful notes together so that when someone needs an uncommon info about a free software, he can always find it here.

In order to view the notes online with an awesome search functionality, head to: [Notes.foss-project.com](http://Notes.foss-project.com). Our GitHub repository can be found at: (https://github.com/foss-project/notes)[https://github.com/foss-project/notes]. You can send us a pull request from there.

## Contributing

Remember, this is FOSS **Notes**, not FOSS **DOCS**. Don't list usage options or everything you know about a software. Only write down your organized notes. Those notes may include:

* A bug which you faced during the usage of the software.
* A solution for that bug that you faced or a workaround.
* A tip which is not generally known about a software.
* An optimization for a software.
* Similar stuff to the above.

Everything you send should be in markdown format. You can create a folder about a wide topic (such as bootloaders) and add a sub file in it about a software (such as GRUB2 or Lilo). Everything related to a single software should be in a single file.

Use the following prefixes to describe your entries:

* [Problem]: Bug or problem which you encountered while using the software.
* [Tip]: A quick-and-dirty trick related to the software or optimizations.
* [Note]: It's not a bug nor a tip. Just something to be careful about when using the software.

Each entry can consist of the following subtitles:

* Description: Describe the note, bug or tip you are talking about. Don't explain how to fix it or apply the tip here. Just explain what you are talking about or what you are going to do.
* Solution: The solution or the workaround for the problem you faced. Or how to apply the tip or optimization you talked about before.
* Additional Information: You may add sources or links in this section.

Use H1 for the file title. Use H2 for the entries title and use H3 for subtitles such as "Description" and others.

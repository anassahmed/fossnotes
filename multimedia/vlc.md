## [Problem] VLC Is Missing Some Codecs on openSUSE

### Description

openSUSE doesn't ship some codecs by default due to [patents and other law-related stuff](https://en.opensuse.org/Restricted_formats). Therefore, you may face this problem if you try to install VLC on openSUSE.

### Solution

You need to [install codecs from Packman repository](http://opensuse-community.org/).
